<h1>CloudWalk's CLI - Emulating apps</h1>

<p class="more-info"><%= I18n.t("general.updated_at", :date => "16/09/2014") %></p>

<p>Once your application is created, we can see it working using one of two possible commands of the CLI:</p>

<p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td><code>cloudwalk emulate</code></td>
    <td>
Run mruby apps generated by our build process <b>with</b> our
graphical emulator. It will spawn a new window containing a
colorful device, with a screen, buttons and a printer. Use
<code>cloudwalk help emulate</code> to learn more about this
command.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>cloudwalk run</code></td>
    <td>
Run mruby apps generated by our build process <b>without</b> our
graphical emulator. As it's only in text mode, it's capabilities
are limited, but it's highly useful for testing. Use
<code>cloudwalk help run</code> to learn more about this command.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>About <code>cloudwalk run</code>:</b>
This command is intended to work like
<code>mruby -b</code>, so if you emulate your apps with it it
won't work as the <code>emulate</code> command: it will probabbly
just quit if you have nothing to run outside of the Main class.
</p>

<p>
A <code>cloudwalk emulate</code> call will work right away, but
if you don't want to use the graphical UI, you might want to use
<code>cloudwalk run</code>, therefore you will have to add
<code>Main.call</code> at the end of your scripts, or use a test
file at the <i>test</i> folder inside your app. To un tests, use
the commands as they appear in <code>rake -T</code>.
</p>

<p>
The main implemented <code>rake</code> functionalities are the
following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><code>rake build</code>:</b>            Compiles an app and it's resources into files of extension <code>.mrb</code>.</li>
  <li><b><code>rake clean</code>:</b>            Cleans the previous rake actions.</li>
  <li><b><code>rake test:all</code>:</b>         Run all tests.</li>
  <li><b><code>rake test:integration</code>:</b> Run only the integration tests.</li>
  <li><b><code>rake test:unit</code>:</b>        Run only the unit tests.</li>
</ul>
