<h1>CloudWalk's CLI - Emulating an app</h1>

<p class="more-info"><%= I18n.t("general.updated_at", :date => "16/09/2014") %></p>

<p>Once your application is created, we can see it working using one of two possible commands of the CLI:</p>

<p>
<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td><code>cloudwalk emulate</code></td>
    <td>
Run mruby apps generated by our build process <b>with</b> our
graphical emulator. It will spawn a new window containing a
colorful device, with a screen, buttons and a printer. Use
<code>cloudwalk help emulate</code> to learn more about this
command.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>cloudwalk run</code></td>
    <td>
Run mruby apps generated by our build process <b>without</b> our
graphical emulator. As it's only in text mode, it's capabilities
are limited, but it's highly useful for testing. Use
<code>cloudwalk help run</code> to learn more about this command.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
