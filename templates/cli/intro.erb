<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
CloudWalk provides you with a <i>command line interface</i> tool
that allows you to control your companies and applications in an
easy way. In this guide, you'll learn how to set up your first
paymet application in minutes, and it will empower you to make
lightning fast changes and deploy them directly into your
terminals from the command line interface of your preference.
</p>

<p>
We'll try to be as specific as possible, so feel free to skip to
the information that looks relevant to you.
</p>

<h2 id="cli">Command Line Interface</h2>

<p>
A command line interface (CLI) is a character user interface that
dates back to when there was not enough technology to put
pictures on the internet, but has prevailed since then as the
favorite tool for many developers to interact with computers. In
windows it's possible to use the MSDOS terminal, in Mac OS it's
called iTerm and in Linux it's usually called Terminal or Xterm,
in them there are usually plenty of commands to interact with the
operative system, herein we introduce our CLI tool, called
<b>cloudwalk</b>, which will be available at your terminal of
preference and will serve you as a text-only shortcut to manage
your company's account and your applications. It also has
additional features: you can compile, emulate and deploy your
application directly from the CLI.
</p>

<h2 id=#da_funk">CloudWalk's Ruby Framework API</h2>

<p>
As you might know (thanks to our docs on the left of this site)
our Ruby Framework is built to facilitate your development
experience and is released ready to work on several platforms
such as Verifone, Ingenico and PAX.
</p>

<p>
To let you build amazing Ruby applications, we've made an API
client available within Ruby, that gives you all the methods
you'll need, making it easy to interact with the POS terminal's
screen, printer, keyboard, network and to process different types
of payments. This tool is called <b>DaFunk</b> and it's
<a href="https://github.com/cloudwalkio/da_funk" target="_blank">open source</a>.
We'll teach you the ways around it's functions so you can exploit
it's potential.
</p>

<h2 id="skeleton">CloudWalk Skeleton</h2>

<p>
Our CLI will let you create new apps, they will be based on the
<b>cloudwalk-skeleton</b>, a structure which is
<a href="https://github.com/scalone/cloudwalk-skeleton" target="_blank">open source</a>
too, and could be useful for other projects, be creative! And let us know your experience,
through feedback we grow!
</p>

<h2 id="full-guide">Full Guide</h2>

<p>
What's next? Let's rock this, go ahead into the full guide,
follow the instructions and (with some of our magic) you'll be
making payment applications like hot bread.
