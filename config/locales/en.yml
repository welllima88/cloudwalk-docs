      functionality:
        paragraph_1: The access to the API must be done from the domain <span class='code'>https://api.cloudwalk.io/%{version}</span>.
        paragraph_2: The requests should be made using the <strong>HTTPS</strong> protocol.
        paragraph_3: 'All date and time records are returned in ISO 8601 standard:'
      versioning:
        paragraph_1: When using the CloudWalk API, it is necessary to provide the version being used. Currently only the version <strong>v1</strong> is available for use, but eventually new versions will become available.
        paragraph_2: 'Example of URL: <span class="code">https://api.cloudwalk.io/v1/devices</span>'
      api_token:
        paragraph_1: 'All operations available on the API interface should always use a valid API token. The API token management is done directly on the CloudWalk Manager, by simply accessing the top menu <strong>My account</strong>, and then the option <strong>API</strong>.'
        paragraph_2: 'Example of URL:'
      rate_limiting:
        paragraph_1: "By default, an IP address is allowed to perform up to 5,000 requests per hour. The rate limit status can be checked on the HTTP headers of any API request:"
      crud:
        paragraph_1: To perform an operation on a resource (app, logical number, group, etc), a HTTP request is made to the URL using the appropriate HTTP verb.
        paragraph_2: 'The four HTTP verbs used in CRUD operations are:'
        paragraph_3: '<strong>GET: </strong>Finds a specific resource or collection of resources from an URL. For example, <span class="code">GET /%{version}/devices</span> returns a list with all serial numbers, while a <span class="code">GET /%{version}/devices/135</span> returns only the serial number with the ID 135.'
        paragraph_4: '<strong>POST: </strong>Creates a new resource. For example, <span class="code">POST /%{version}/devices</span> creates a new serial number. The information sent in the POST request would then be used to fill the properties of the serial number.'
        paragraph_5: '<strong>PUT: </strong>Updates an existing resource. For example, <span class="code">PUT /%{version}/devices/135</span> updates the serial number with the ID 135. The information sent in the PUT request would then be used to update the properties of the serial number.'
        paragraph_6: '<strong>DELETE: </strong>Deletes an existing resource. For example, <span class="code">DELETE /%{version}/devices/135</span> deletes the serial number with the ID 135.'
      pagination:
        paragraph_1: Requests that return multiple records are paginated, where the default pagination size is 30 records. The sub-sequent pages are defined by the parameter <span class='code'>&page</span>, which starts on 1. The default amount of returned records can be changed by defining the parameter <span class='code'>&per_page</span>, up to 100 records.

        paragraph_2: "We have prepared a video for demonstration purposes, a simple Hello World with a pause between the messages that are displayed:"
      printing:
        paragraph_1: Another very common task is to print tickets and vouchers. In a convensional development environment, the definition and customization of vouchers and printing tickets might take several days and also consume several rolls of paper, which go straight to trash.
        paragraph_2: With CloudWalk IDE you can define, test, view and modify the vouchers and printing tickets in a virtual, simple and fast interface.
        paragraph_3: "Check out the video below where we demonstrate some basic printing commands:"
        paragraph_4: "Say goodbye to those stacks of printing paper :)"

      introduction:
        paragraph_1: 'There is a way to integrate CloudWalk POSXML applications with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST" class="external" target="blank">REST</a> APIs. It can be done by using the command <a href="/posxml/commands/network.send" class="command">network.send</a> with a string in the following format:'
        paragraph_2: The CloudWalk Switch will receive the request sent through the command <a href="/en/posxml/commands/network.send" class='command'>network.send</a> and will perform the HTTP request on the url defined on the application configured on <a href='https://manager.cloudwalk.io'>https://manager.cloudwalk.io</a>.
        paragraph_3: To receive the answer from CloudWalk Switch, it is necessary to use the command <a href='/en/posxml/commands/network.receive' class='command'>network.receive</a> to receive the first 4 bytes that indicates the size of the message, and then receive the rest of the message with a second <a href='/en/posxml/commands/network.receive' class='command'>network.receive</a> call. This approach avoid timeouts and long wait times to receive the response from your HTTP endpoint.

        item_1: The <strong>Device</strong> captures the data and sends it to the <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong>.
        item_2: The <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong> receives the data and forwards it to the <strong>Authorizer</strong>.
        item_3: The <strong>Authorizer</strong> validates the data and sends a response to the <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong>.
        item_4: Finally, the <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong> forwards the response to the <strong>Device</strong>.
      more_info:
        paragraph_1: The CloudWalk service is extremely flexible when it comes to the communication between POS terminals and the authorizer. Financial applications commonly use the communication protocol <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583' target="blank" class="external">ISO 8583</a>, but other patterns and standards can be used.
        paragraph_2: The transaction validation is an important step because it allows an Issuer to check if the payment mode used is authentic and that the data (value, transaction date, etc.) received by the authorizer is the same data used by the payment method when the transaction was created.
        paragraph_3: In addition to validating the data generated by the payment method, the authorizer is also able to sign the response message (e.g. "transaction authorized") before sending it to the POS terminal, so the authorizer can authenticate the POS and the POS can also authenticate the Issuer, assuring more safety on the process.
        paragraph_4: The CloudWalk service offers all the tools needed to develop applications for the main POS terminals in the market, but does not develop or provide authorization servers.
        paragraph_5: The authorizer development and maintenance is the customer's responsibility.

    memory_and_variables:
      description: The POSXML language has the concept of variable types, where they can be of type string or integer. Limitations and parameter passing.
      introduction: The WALK Framework is responsible for running compiled POSXML applications, and when installed on the device, the POSXML application assumes all responsibility for memory management and devices. Therefore, to run an application on the device, just write a file in POSXML, compile it and send it to the device.
      limitations:
        paragraph_1: There is a limit of 511 variables per POSXML application, <ul><li>256 of type string with maximum size of 1K (1023 characters, of which one is used automatically by the platform to allocate the <span class='code'>\0</span>), </li><li>and 255 of type integer. </li></ul>
        paragraph_2: When you declare a variable with the commands <a href='/en/posxml/commands/integervariable' class='command'>integervariable</a> or <a href='/en/posxml/commands/stringvariable' class='command'>stringvariable</a>, it will be in memory until the device is disconnected. For this reason, you must be careful to declare at the beginning of the application all of the variables that will be used and clean them later, to prevent any errors from occurring during the execution of the application.
        paragraph_3: Currently there is a limit of 32K memory for loading compiled POSXML pages.
      parameters:
        paragraph_1: Every POSXML command owning a parameter whose name contains the word <span class='code'>variable</span>, for example, <span class='code'>variablereturn</span>, is required to have a parameter assigned.
        paragraph_2: 'The assignment of variables is made with the nomenclature <span class="code">$(VariableName)</span>, as can be seen below:'
        paragraph_3: 'When the name of the parameter does not have the word variable, you can pass either a constant or a variable. The assignment is taken as constant in every programming language:'
        paragraph_4: In string variables, it is still possible to pass to the command just a snippet of the indexed variable, as in other programming languages, using pointers to variables.
        paragraph_5: 'In the example below, the following string would be displayed: <strong>H</strong>'
        paragraph_6: 'In the example below, the following string would be displayed: <strong>e</strong>'
        paragraph_7: 'In the example below, the following string would be displayed: <strong>ello World</strong>'
        paragraph_8: In this last example <span class='code'>!</span> symbol was specified so that it will display the characters from the position defined in <span class='code'>intIndex</span> until the end of the string. When the symbol <span class='code'>!</span> is omitted, only the character set in position <span class='code'>intIndex</span> is displayed on the device display.

      title: POSXML - Variables and memory
      variable_types:
        paragraph_1: The POSXML language uses the concept of variable types. It offers two types by which you can store values and manipulate them across your entire application. These are <strong>string</strong> or <strong>integer</strong>. Several POSXML commands require a variable type, which is described in the explanation of each POSXML command operation.
        paragraph_2: You can convert variables of type <strong>integer</strong> to <strong>string</strong> and vice versa, by using the commands <code>inttostring</code> and <code>stringtoint</code>.
        paragraph_3: Variables of type <strong>double</strong> (decimal floating point) can also be used by using string variables with decimal point separated by <code>.</code> (point), and not by <code>,</code> (comma).
    structure:
      case_sensitive:
        paragraph_1: The POSXML language is <em>case sensitive</em>, so there are differences between lowercase and uppercase words. You need to pay attention, especially when naming functions and variables.

      comments:
        paragraph_1: 'Comments blocks should be used with tags <span class="code">&lt;!--</span> and <span class="code">--&gt;</span> as below:'
      description: Organization and Structure, Parent tag or root tags, Case sensitive, Reserved characters, Comments.
      introduction: The POSXML language follows the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML' class='external'>XML</a> open standard. The XML standard is totally flexible and allows for rapid expansion. All formatting rules applied to XML persist in POSXML.
      reserved_characters:
        paragraph_1: All reserved characters in XML are also reserved in POSXML and should be written in the correct way.
        paragraph_2: 'The following symbols on the left should be written as they appear on the right:'
        paragraph_3: 'To display a message with the symbol <span class="code">&lt;</span> (less than), the code would be like:'
      structure:
        paragraph_1: The POSXML language is organized and structured in the form of tags with levels and sublevels of commands that form the logical structure of the application. A tag can be identified when is located between the signs <span class='code'>&lt;</span> (less than) and <span class='code'>></span> (greater than), where they are opened and closed.

Below the root tag, the tag <span class='code'>&lt;pagina nome="principal"&gt;</span> must be created, which is where all the application logic should be done.

        title: "Transaction patterns"
        description: "Learn about your transaction patterns automatically identified by our service."
        table_of_contents:
          introduction: "Introduction"
          pattern: "What is a pattern?"
          anomaly: "What is an anomaly?"
          algorithm: "The core algorithm"
        introduction:
          paragraph_1: "You can see your transaction logs in real-time in CloudWalk Manager at <a href='https://manager.cloudwalk.io/realtime' class='external'>manager.cloudwalk.io/realtime</a>, but it is too difficult to detect any pattern just by looking at the scrolling lines."
          paragraph_2: "To help us, only humans in this task, we created an artificial intelligence service that watches, in real-time, each log line generated by your transactions, looking for patterns and anomalies within them."
        pattern:
          paragraph_1: "Our algorithm looks for patterns, but what is a pattern?"
          paragraph_2: "For our purposes, a pattern is a set of somewhat similar transactions. To discover which transactions are similar, our algorithm keeps an eye on the size of messages sent by your POS to your authorizer and on the size of messages received in response. A pattern is then a set of transactions with similar sized messages. It's the algorithm's job to find those similar transactions."
          paragraph_3: "To help the algorithm, we separate all your transactions by application, meaning that any pattern created is a transaction pattern for a specific application. More on that later!"
        anomaly:
          paragraph_1: "An anomaly is a transaction that does not fit in any previously seen pattern. So an anomalous transaction has messages with unusual (until then) sizes. As our algorithm keeps learning from your transactions, it will eventually recognize a recurring anomaly as a new pattern, and will stop giving you any warnings about it."
          paragraph_2: "Be cautious when giving meaning to an anomalous transaction. It does not necessarily mean something bad has happened. As an example, when you start testing a new application, you will probably see a lot of anomalous transactions, as they won't fit any previously seen pattern."
        algorithm:
          paragraph_1: "At the core of the service there is an algorithm called <em>density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise</em> (<a href='http://www.wikiwand.com/en/DBSCAN' class='external'>DBSCAN</a>), which we modified to work efficiently with discrete streaming data (as those from your logs), calling it <em>discrete density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise</em> (DDBSCAN). Our DDBSCAN implementation is available as a <a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ddbscan/' class='external'>Python package</a> and its source code is open at <a href='https://github.com/cloudwalkio/ddbscan' class='external'>Github</a>."

          paragraph_3: "When this situation arises, you can hover the mouse over the circle representing the transaction to see how many times a transaction with same message size was seen, along with other information, like the time of it's last occurrence. You can also click on it to see the message buffer of its last ocurrence."
        parameters:
          paragraph_1: "We can set our model parameters by clicking on the cog in front of the application name. You will see two sliders that can be used to change some parameters of your detector."
          paragraph_2: "Our algorithm relies on two parameters that effectively setup its sensitiveness, one of them controlling how easy/hard it is to flag two transactions as similar and the other controlling how many of these similar transactions we need to define a new pattern:"
          list:
            item_1: "<strong>What amount of similar transactions defines a pattern:</strong> this parameter controls how easy/hard it is for the algorithm to define a new pattern. If we say a small amount of similar transactions defines a pattern (slider to the left), then the algorithm will create new patterns after seeing few similar transactions. On the other extreme, setting this parameter to many similar transactions defining a pattern (slider to the right), the algorithm will have to see many similar transactions occuring before saying they form a pattern. In summary, as the slider goes left to right we will be detecting less to more anomalies, or alternatively, more to less patterns."
            item_2: "<strong>How similar a set of transactions should be in order to define a pattern:</strong> this parameter controls how easy/hard it is for two transactions to be considered as similar. If we say they need to be little similar (slider to left), then it will flag transactions as similar more easily, i.e., it will flag transactions with message sizes not so similar as similar. On the other extreme, saying the transactions need to be very similar (slider to right), means the algorithm will be more selective when flaging transactions as similar, i.e., it will only flag as similar transactions with close messages sizes. Oversimplifying, as the slider goes left to right we will be detecting less to more anomalies, or alternatively, more to less patterns."
        play_with_it:
          paragraph_1: "To you get a better sense of the effect of each parameter in the algorithm, we created a simulation which you can interact with. Just play with the sliders:<br>"
          paragraph_2: "If you are having trouble understanding it, remember that each circle in this chart represents one transaction, each pattern being represented by its unique color: circles with same color belongs to same pattern. The small sized gray circles represents anomalous transactions and don't belong to any pattern."
          paragraph_3: "Notice that when the parameters are somewhere in the middle of the scale we get reasonably patterns, so this may be the best setting for you. In fact, this is our default settings."

      introduction:
        paragraph_1: "Some POS applications might need to interact with other devices via serial ports. Using real devices it can be tricky but nothing puzzling, however you might wonder how to test your code under the web development environment. The web is not able to use serial ports, but we have developed some tools to help you with this process, and here we will explain how to use these functionalities."
        paragraph_2: "The way we let you have serial ports is by setting some values organized by port number, rate and configuration values, so instead of having a memory place where you retrieve things that arrive from another device, there will be a place where the program takes values, but you pre-define them."
      creating_ports:
        paragraph_1: "Once you open an application on the IDE, go to the icon that looks like a tree, click it and you will see the ports panel:"
        img_1_alt: "Ports icon and panel"
        paragraph_2: "If it is your first time there, you will see two values which correspond to two different port configurations (more on it later). For now, let's create a new port."
        paragraph_3: "There is a form on the ports panel that consists on 4 fields, where the first three fields let you choose your port number, rate and configuration value. The last input field is where you put the data that will be read from your application. Pick your settings, click <b>Create</b> and you will see your port added to the list below."
        img_2_alt: "Creating ports"
      emulating:
        paragraph_1: "A simple code that we can use to read and write into the ports is the following:"
        paragraph_2: "Open the emulator panel and press the green <b>POWER</b> button, the code will read one time from the port with number <b>COM2</b>, rate <b>1200</b>, and configuration <b>A701</b>, after that it will write <b>CloudWalk</b> in that port, and finally it will read it again to retrieve the value we just wrote. The emulation will go as follows:"
