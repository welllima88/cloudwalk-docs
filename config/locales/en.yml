      rate_limiting:
        paragraph_1: "By default, an IP address is allowed to perform up to 5,000 requests per hour. The rate limit status can be checked on the HTTP headers of any API request:"
      crud:
        paragraph_1: To perform an operation on a resource (app, logical number, group, etc), a HTTP request is made to the URL using the appropriate HTTP verb.
        paragraph_2: 'The four HTTP verbs used in CRUD operations are:'
        paragraph_3: '<strong>GET: </strong>Finds a specific resource or collection of resources from an URL. For example, <span class=''code''>GET /%{version}/devices</span> returns a list with all serial numbers, while a <span class=''code''>GET /%{version}/devices/135</span> returns only the serial number with the ID 135.'
        paragraph_4: '<strong>POST: </strong>Creates a new resource. For example, <span class=''code''>POST /%{version}/devices</span> creates a new serial number. The information sent in the POST request would then be used to fill the properties of the serial number.'
        paragraph_5: '<strong>PUT: </strong>Updates an existing resource. For example, <span class=''code''>PUT /%{version}/devices/135</span> updates the serial number with the ID 135. The information sent in the PUT request would then be used to update the properties of the serial number.'
        paragraph_6: '<strong>DELETE: </strong>Deletes an existing resource. For example, <span class=''code''>DELETE /%{version}/devices/135</span> deletes the serial number with the ID 135.'
      pagination:
        paragraph_1: Requests that return multiple records are paginated, where the default pagination size is 30 records. The sub-sequent pages are defined by the parameter <span class='code'>&page</span>, which starts on 1. The default amount of returned records can be changed by defining the parameter <span class='code'>&per_page</span>, up to 100 records.

      introduction:
        paragraph_1: In order to increase productivity and to facilitate the development of POSXML applications, we have created an emulator that precisely reproduces the behavior of a POS terminal or a smartphone.
        paragraph_2: The emulator runs directly on CloudWalk IDE, ie directly in a web browser, eliminating the need of any kind of installation or configuration.
        paragraph_3: It's never been easier to develop for POS terminals and smarphones!
      workflow:
        paragraph_1: A common task in any kind of development is to test the workflow of the application being developed. With CloudWalk IDE you can at any time press the <strong>Compile</strong> button, and then press the <strong>Emulator</strong> button to start the emulation.

      introduction:
        paragraph_1: 'There is a way to integrate CloudWalk POSXML applications with <a href=''https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST'' class=''external'' target=''blank''>REST</a> APIs. It can be done by using the command <a href=''/posxml/commands/network.send'' class=''command''>network.send</a> with a string in the following format:'
        paragraph_2: The CloudWalk Switch will receive the request sent through the command <a href='/en/posxml/commands/network.send' class='command'>network.send</a> and will perform the HTTP request on the url defined on the application configured on <a href='https://manager.cloudwalk.io'>https://manager.cloudwalk.io</a>.
        paragraph_3: To receive the answer from CloudWalk Switch, it is necessary to use the command <a href='/en/posxml/commands/network.receive' class='command'>network.receive</a> to receive the first 4 bytes that indicates the size of the message, and then receive the rest of the message with a second <a href='/en/posxml/commands/network.receive' class='command'>network.receive</a> call. This approach avoid timeouts and long wait times to receive the response from your HTTP endpoint.

      description: Component responsible to validate the information provided by POS terminals.
      overview:
        paragraph_1: 'Authorizer is the component responsible to verify and validate the information provided by POS terminals. The information that travels over the CloudWalk network follows the following flow:'
        item_1: The <strong>Device</strong> captures the data and sends it to the <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong>;
        item_2: The <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong> receives the data and forwards it to the <strong>Authorizer</strong>;
        item_3: The <strong>Authorizer</strong> validates the data and sends a response to the <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong>;
        item_4: Finally, the <strong>CloudWalk Service</strong> forwards the response to the <strong>Device</strong>.
      more_info:
        paragraph_1: The CloudWalk service is extremely flexible when it comes to the communication between POS terminals and the authorizer. Financial applications commonly uses the communication protocol <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583' target="blank" class="external">ISO 8583</a>, but other patterns and standards can be used.
        paragraph_2: The transaction validation is an important step because it allows an Issuer to check if the payment mode used is authentic and that the data (value, transaction date, etc.) received by the authorizer is the same data used by the payment method when the transaction was created.
        paragraph_3: In addition to validating the data generated by the payment method, the authorizer is also able to sign the response message (e.g. "transaction authorized") before sending it to the POS terminal, so the authorizer can authenticate the POS and the POS can also authenticate the Issuer, assuring more safety on the process.
        paragraph_4: The CloudWalk service offers all the tools needed to develop applications for the main POS terminals in the market, but does not develop or provides authorization servers.
        paragraph_5: The authorizer development and maintenance is the customer's responsibility.

      title: POSXML - File System
    memory_and_variables:
      description: The POSXML has the concept of variable types, where they can be of type string or integer. Limitations and parameter passing.
      introduction: The WALK Framework is responsible for running compiled POSXML application, and being installed on the device, assumes all responsibility for memory management and devices. Thus, to run an application on the device, just write a file in POSXML, compile it and send it to the device.
      limitations:
        paragraph_1: There is a limit of 511 variables per POSXML application, and 256 of type string with maximum size of 1K (1023 characters, of which one is used automatically by the platform to allocate the <span class='code'>\0</span>), and 255 of type integer.
        paragraph_2: When you declare a variable with the commands <a href='/en/posxml/commands/integervariable' class='command'>integervariable</a> or <a href='/en/posxml/commands/stringvariable' class='command'>stringvariable</a>, it will be in memory of the application until the device is disconnected. For this reason, you must be careful to define on the beginning of the application all variables used and clean them for no errors occur during the execution of the application.
        paragraph_3: Currently there is a limit of 32K memory for loading compiled POSXML pages.
      parameters:
        paragraph_1: Every POSXML command owning a parameter whose name contains the word <span class='code'>variable</span>, for example, <span class='code'>variablereturn</span>, is required to pass a variable to that parameter.
        paragraph_2: 'The assignment of variables is made with nomenclature <span class=''code''>$(VariableName)</span>, as can be seen below:'
        paragraph_3: 'When the name of the parameter does not have the word variable, you can pass either a constant or a variable. The assignment is taken as constant in every programming language:'
        paragraph_4: In variables string, it is still possible to pass to the command only a snippet of the indexed variable, as in other programming languages, using pointers to variables.
        paragraph_5: 'In the example below, the following string would be displayed: <strong>H</strong>'
        paragraph_6: 'In the example below, the following string would be displayed: <strong>e</strong>'
        paragraph_7: 'In the example below, the following string would be displayed: <strong>ello World</strong>'
        paragraph_8: In the last example was specified <span class='code'>!</span> symbol so that it displays the characters from the position defined in <span class='code'>intIndex</span> till the end of the string. When the symbol <span class='code'>!</span> is omitted, only the character set in position <span class='code'>intIndex</span> is displayed on device's display.

      title: POSXML - Variables and memory
      variable_types:
        paragraph_1: The POSXML has the concept of variable types, where they can be of type <strong>string</strong> or <strong>integer</strong>. Several POSXML commands require a variable type, which is described in the explanation of operation commands.
        paragraph_2: You can convert variables of type <strong>integer</strong> to <strong>string</strong> and vice versa, by simply using the commands inttostring and stringtoint.
        paragraph_3: Variables of type <strong>double</strong> (decimal floating point) can also be used by using variables of type string with decimal point separated by <strong>.</Strong> (point), and not by comma.
    structure:
      case_sensitive:
        paragraph_1: The POSXML is <em>case sensitive</em>, so there are differences between the lowercase and uppercase words. You need to pay attention, especially when naming functions and variables.
        paragraph_2: 'Example:'
      comments:
        paragraph_1: 'Comments blocks should be used with tags <span class=''code''>&lt;!--</span> and <span class=''code''>--&gt;</span> as below:'
      description: Organization and Structure, Parent tag or root tags, Case sensitive, Reserved characters, Comments.
      introduction: The POSXML follows the open standard <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML' class='external'>XML</a>, widespread in the software industry. The XML standard is totally flexible and allows rapid expansion. All formatting rules applied to XML still exist in POSXML.
      reserved_characters:
        paragraph_1: All reserved characters in XML are also reserved in POSXML and should be written in a right way.
        paragraph_2: 'The following symbols should be written:'
        paragraph_3: 'To display a message with the symbol <span class=''code''>&lt;</span> (less than), the code would be like:'
      structure:
        paragraph_1: The POSXML is organized and structured in the form of tags with levels and sublevels of commands that form the logical structure of the application POSXML. A tag can be identified when is located between the signs <span class='code'>&lt;</span> (less than) and <span class='code'>></span> (greater than), where they shall be opened and closed.

      tag_root:

Below the root tag, the tag <span class='code'>&lt;pagina nome="principal"&gt;</span> must be created, which is where all the application logic should be done.

          introduction: "Introduction"
          pattern: "What is a pattern?"
          anomaly: "What is an anomaly?"
          algorithm: "The core algorithm"
        introduction:
          paragraph_1: "You can see your transactions logs in real-time in CloudWalk Manager at <a href='https://manager.cloudwalk.io/realtime' class='external'>manager.cloudwalk.io/realtime</a>, but it is too difficult to detect any pattern just by looking at the scrolling lines."
          paragraph_2: "To help us, only humans, in this task, we created an artificial intelligence service that watch, in real-time, each log line generate by your transactions, looking for patterns and anomalies in them."
        pattern:
          paragraph_1: "Our algorithm looks for patterns, but what is a pattern?"
          paragraph_2: "For our purposes, a pattern is a set of somewhat similar transactions. To find which transactions are similar, our algorithm keep an eye at the sizes of messages sent by your POS to your authorizer and at the sizes of messages received in response. A pattern is then a set of transactions with similar sized messages. It's the algorithm's job to find those similar transactions."
          paragraph_3: "To help the algorithm, we separate all your transactions by application, meaning that any pattern created is a transaction pattern for a specific application. More on that later!"
        anomaly:
          paragraph_1: "An anomaly is a transaction that does not fit in any previously seen pattern. So an anomalous transaction has messages with unusual (until then) sizes. As our algorithm keeps learning from your transactions, it will eventually recognize a recurring anomaly as a new pattern, and will stop giving you any warnings about it."
          paragraph_2: "Be cautious when giving meaning to an anomalous transaction. It does not necessarily means something bad has happened. As an example, when you start testing a new application, you will probably see a lot of anomalous transactions, as they won't fit any previously seen pattern."
        algorithm:
          paragraph_1: "At the core of the service there is an algorithm called <em>density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise</em> (<a href='http://www.wikiwand.com/en/DBSCAN' class='external'>DBSCAN</a>), which we modified to work efficiently with discrete streaming data (as those from your logs), calling it <em>discrete density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise</em> (DDBSCAN). Our DDBSCAN implementation is available as a <a href='https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ddbscan/' class='external'>Python package</a> and its source code is open at <a href='https://github.com/cloudwalkio/ddbscan' class='external'>Github</a>."

        paragraph_2: "This is the default tab you arrive when you access the transactions patterns URL."
        paragraph_3: "As you can see in the above image, we highlight the time when we detected the last anomaly."
        paragraph_4: "Down the screen you can see a table with the ten last anomalies detected. You can expand each line of the table to see more details about the corresponding transaction by clicking at the plus sign. The details for the transaction includes time, application name, serial number, size and message buffers for the sent data and the received one. This is helpful to see exactly what triggered the anomaly detector, so that you can investigate it further."

          paragraph_2: "This nice colorful chart is a representation of your transactions. The horizontal axis corresponds to the size of the message sent by your POS and vertical axis corresponds to the size of the message received in response. Each circle represents a transaction with specific sizes for the sent and received messages."
          paragraph_3: "The colorful circles represents patterns: same color transactions belongs to same pattern. You can see some smaller circles the same color the greater ones: they also belong to same pattern, but they barely made into it."
          paragraph_4: "The little gray circles are all anomalous transactions and don't belong to any pattern. The little gray squares represents the last ten anomalies."
          paragraph_5: "The big square is your latest transaction, and if it is grey, it's an anomalous transaction."

            item_4: "You can also use your mousewheel to zoom in/out."
        transactions_stacks:
          paragraph_1: "Notice that it can happen that one single circle represents more than one transaction."
          paragraph_2: "As an example, if you are sending pings from your POS to your server, you expect the same messages being sent and received each time, so their circles get stacked in the graph."
          paragraph_3: "When having this situation, you can hover the mouse over the circle representing the transaction to see how many times a transaction with same messages sizes was seen, along with other information, like the time of it's last occurrence. You can also click on it to see the message's buffer of its last ocurrence."
        parameters:
          paragraph_1: "In the area at the right side of the chart, we have two sliders you can use to change some parameters of your detector."
          paragraph_2: "Our algorithm relies on two parameters that effectively setup its sensitiveness, one of them controlling how easy/hard it is to flag two transactions as similar and the other controlling how many of these similar transactions we need to define a new pattern:"
          list:
            item_1: "<strong>Which amount of similar transactions defines a pattern:</strong> this parameter controls how easy/hard it is for the algorithm to define a new pattern. If we say a few amount of similar transactions defines a pattern (slider to the left), then the algorithm will create new patterns after seeing few similar transactions. On the other extreme, setting this parameter to many similar transactions definning a pattern (slider to the right), the algorithm will have to see many similar transactions occuring before saying they form a pattern. In summary, as the slider goes left to right we will be detecting less to more anomalies, or alternatively, more to less patterns."
            item_2: "<strong>How similar a set of transactions should be in order to define a pattern:</strong> this parameter controls how easy/hard it is for two transactions to be considered as similar. If we say they need to be little similar (slider to left), then it will flag transactions as similar more easily, i.e., it will flag transactions with messages sizes not so similar as similar. On the other extreme, saying the transactions need to be very similar (slider to right), means the algorithm will be more selectful when flaging transactions as similar, i.e., it will only flag as similar transactions with close messages sizes. Oversimplifying, as the slider goes left to right we will be detecting less to more anomalies, or alternatively, more to less patterns."
        play_with_it:
          paragraph_1: "To you get a better sense of the effect of each parameter in the algorithm, we created a simulation which you can interact with. Just play with the sliders:<br>"
          paragraph_2: "If you are having trouble understanding it, remember that each circle in this chart represents one transaction, each pattern being represented by its unique color: circles with same color belongs to same pattern. The small sized gray circles represents anomalous transactions and don't belong to any pattern."
          paragraph_3: "Notice that when the parameters are somewhere in the middle of the scale we get reasonably patterns, so this may be the best setting for you. In fact, this is our default settings."

        cloudwalk: CloudWalk
      device_questions:
        question_1: How I can reset the certificate that is already installed on the Verifone EVO POS terminals?
        answer_1: To do this reset you must get in touch with your terminal supplier, so they can send you a reset file that will be used to reset the certificate.
        question_2: "How i can add new files on my device, for exemple: imagens, text, etc?"
        answer_2: First compress the images and files that you want(<strong>atention</strong>, the files and images must be on the root of the zip file and the extension must be .zip, not .rar). After this, go to the files section on your CloudWalk manager environment and upload the zip file. Now select the Edit option on the application that will use the files and select the file that must be downloaded along with the application.
        question_3: I just finished some alterations on my application, and I would like to updated on the device, How should I proceed?
        answer_3: To accomplish the update, you need to go to the configuration menu, that its accessed through the button F on ingenico devices, F1 on Verifone Devices and the menu option on the screen of the model VX680 from Verifone, type the password, type 1 for the CloudWalk option, next type 2 for the Delete Apps option, Confirm then press ENTER to download the updated application
        question_4: What’s the best device model that I have to buy and use?
        answer_4: "That depends on your project planning, must be verified if the devices that will be purchased, attend all the needs and requiriments of the project, for exemple: If you wish to process credit and debit transactions on establishments that need more mobility during the payment process, e.g gas station, you should acquire the model IWL280(Ingenico) or Vx680(Verifone), with 'GPRS' communication support, and that are also among the compatible and approved devices to operate with full compatibility with CloudWalk Framework."
        question_5: I’m trying to perform the CloudWalk framework load through the pendrive, but when connect to the device, the load doesn’t start.
        answer_5: "Check if the pendrive is formated as FAT32. Now verify is the folder and the file package was correctly copy to the device, in case you are using a POS terminal from Verifone: Evo, justo the file VERIFONE.zip must be present on the pendrive root, in case you are using a device from Ingenico: Telium 1/ Telium 2, verify if just the TELIUM folder is on the root of the pendrive."
        question_6: It’s possible to use multi applications on the devices?
        answer_6: Yes, for that, your applications must be develop on the CloudWalk IDE. Then on the applications groups on CloudWalk Manager, mark the desire applications to belong on the same group, when you clear the app on the device and download them again, the menu will show to the user the list of apps.
      posxml_questions:
        question_1: What's POSXML?
        answer_1: POSXML (acronym for Point Of Sale extended Markup Language) is a programming language that is used to create applications for a POS terminal. Normally the programming language used to develop such applications is C or C++. This development requires an in-depth knowledge of both the technical specifications of the machine (Hardware) and the programming language. The main purpose of POSXML is to simplify the development of applications for POS terminals. It contains a set of instructions and pre-programmed commands, which allow direct interaction with the machine, resulting in a large reduction in application development time.
        question_2: What's the max. size supported by a string type variable in POSXML language?
        answer_2: 1024 bytes.
        question_3: Are there reserved characters or words in the POSXML language?
        answer_3: "Yes, following the reserved characters:"
        answer_3-1: "Here, you can read more information about the structure of POSXML language: <a href='https://docs.cloudwalk.io/en/posxml/structure ' target='blank' class='external'>POSXML Structure</a>"
        question_4: It’s possible to develop a new application and perform the integration using the standard ISO8583?
        answer_4: Yes, the POSXML language has all the necessary commands to perform an integration using the standard ISO8583
      comm_questions:
        question_1: What types of communication can I use to make the transaction?
        answer_1: Ethernet, GPRS and Dialed
        question_2: What types of integrations are available in the CloudWalk platform?
        answer_2: TCP, HTTP, Simple and Rest
        question_3: I’m using the Ethernet communication type, and I would like to configure my device to work on a DHCP network, how can I do that?
        answer_3: "When setting up the ethernet network, set the IP to '0.0.0.0', after the device restarts the IP is assigned automatically (alvez have to set some parameters manually, eg IP: 0.0.0.0, Network Mask: 255.255.255.0 , Gateway: 192.168.1.1, DNS 1: 8.8.8.8, DNS 2: 8.8.4.4, SSL: 0-No)."
        question_4: I’m using the GPRS communication type, which APN, user and password I must set?
        answer_4: "First you must verify if your GPRS chip uses privete or public APN, you can verify this information with your GPRS chip supplier or provider. In case you acquired the chip through a Telecommunication enterprise, for exemple, Lyra Network, probably it will use an private APN, if the the chip its a regular one, use the public APN, then you must enter the user and password according to each provider. CloudWalk provides an configuration menu intuitive and simple, you just have to select the provider, then the parameters: user, password and APN will be set automatically on the background. If you don’t find your provider, you can set the parameters manually selecting the option ‘Other operator’"
        question_5: "It’s possible to define the communications type 'Dialed/Landline' SDLC or PPP to perform transactions?"
        answer_5: "Yes, it is, first verify if the device has the support for this kind of communication, next with the configurations paramters in hand, access the POS terminal menu by pressing 'F'(Ingenico) or 'F1'(Verifone) on the main screen(in case you use the default password, type: '55555' to access the configuration menu), select the option 'COMMUNICATION', now select the type: 'SDLC' or 'PPP' and inform the line data."
        question_6: The device does not connect, what might be happening?
        answer_6:
          paragraph_1: "First identify the error code and message displayed on the device screen after the connection attempt. For each type of connection used, must be carried out some basic checks to identify what is happening when you try to connect:"
          ethernet:
            title:  "<strong>ETHERNET</strong>"
            step_1: "—</strong> Make sure the network cable is properly connected to the device or if it is damaged."
            step_2: "—</strong> Check the device's network settings, parameters: IP, Gateway, Subnet mask, DNS 1, DNS 2 and SSL must necessarily be completed in accordance with the default configuration of your network (if you have doubts about your network configuration, ask your network administrator for your company or establishment)."
            step_3: "—</strong> Make sure that there are no restrictions and rules on the network that may block the connection to the target host."
            step_4: "—</strong> If your network accepted DHCP connections, set the ip '0.0.0.0' to your device, to restart it, an IP is automatically assigned to it, then be able to connect normally (you may need to set some parameters manually, example : IP: 0.0.0.0, Network Mask: 255.255.255.0, Gateway: 192.168.1.1, DNS 1: 8.8.8.8, DNS 2: 8.8.4.4, SSL: 0-no)."
            step_5: "—</strong> Make sure there is really connectivity in this particular point network, that is, ensure that another device is able to contact perfectly, you can test with another device or a closer notebook for example, so that confirm that the problem is not the point network"
            step_6: "—</strong> Make sure the destination host (your authorizer server or API) is responding successfully and is active"
            step_7: "—</strong> Make sure that your device has been registered in CloudWalk platform, i.e, the serial number of the same must be properly released in CloudWalk Manager."
            step_8: "—</strong> Make sure that the logical number assigned to your device was registered correctly in CloudWalk Manager and if it is related to a group of applications."
          gprs:
            title: <strong>GPRS:</strong>
            step_1: —</strong> Make sure the chip is operating normally in more than one device.
            step_2: —</strong> If the SIM card is prepaid, check if it has credit.
            step_3: —</strong> Verify if the chip has been unlocked.
            step_4: —</strong> Check the APN configuration, if it is public or private.
            step_5: —</strong> Check the Signal
          dialed:
            title: <strong>DIALED:</strong>
            step_1: —</strong> Check the cable
            step_2: —</strong> Check for interference
            step_3: —</strong> Get in touch with your provider
      config_questions:
        question_1: I would like to change the "background" image on the home screen and place the logo of my company, it is possible?
        answer_1: Yes, you only need to upload the image (on bmp format with the name walk.bmp) you desire on the manager and associate with your application, to do this you just update your application selecting the image that you have uploaded.
        question_2: What’s a Authorizer Server?
        answer_2: For all transaction originated from a POS be valid, the terminal must exchange informations with a Authorizer Server, which can be accomplished through a communication protocol, which is a standardized language for exchange data that can be extended  to all involved modules. In addition to validating the data generated by the payment method, the authorizer is also able to sign a response message before sending it to the sale terminal. So not only the authorizer can authenticate the POS, but the POS can also authenticate your Issuer, which guarantees even more safety to the whole process.
        question_3: How to set the address of the authorizing server of our company that the transactions will be sent?
        answer_3: On the application registration is required to inform the authorizer, you must fill the form with its address. With this simple step the authorizer of your company is set.
        question_4: Can we use more than one address host to an application?
        answer_4: No! Actually, only one host can be set for an application, all modules of this application will use the same host to transact.
